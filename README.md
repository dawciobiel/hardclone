# Legacy Versions of Hardclone

This branch contains historical versions of the `hardclone` application, from version `0.0.1` to `0.1.2`.  
These versions are **no longer maintained** and are kept here for archival and reference purposes only.

If you are looking for the current, actively developed version of the application, please refer to the [`main`](https://github.com/dawciobiel/hardclone/tree/main) branch.

## ⚠️ Important Notice

Do **not** use these legacy versions for new projects or deployments.  
They may contain outdated code, incomplete features, or bugs that have since been fixed.
